In a dual-supply application, however, VDD I/O can differ from VS to accommodate the desired interface voltage, as long as VS is greater than or equal to VDD I/O.

G | 12 of 36The ADXL345 is a complete 3-axis acceleration measurement system with a selectable measurement range of ±2 g, ±4 g, ±8 g, or ±16 g. It measures both dynamic acceleration resulting from motion or shock and static acceleration, such as gravity, that allows the device to be used as a tilt sensor. The sensor is a polysilicon surface-micromachined structure built on top of a silicon wafer. Polysilicon springs suspend the structure over the surface of the wafer and provide a resistance against forces due to applied acceleration.\n",

The 1/f corner of the device, as shown in this figure, is very low, allowing absolute resolution of approximately 100 µg (assuming that there is sufficient integration time). Figure 52 also shows that the noise density is 290 µg/ √Hz for the x-axis and y-axis and 430 µg/ √Hz for the z-axis.

      "All possible power-on modes are summar-ized in Table 6 . The interface voltage level is set with the interface supply voltage, VDD I/O, which must be present to ensure that the ADXL345 does not create a conflict on the communication bus. For single-supply operation, VDD I/O can be the same as the main supply, VS. In a dual-supply application, however, VDD I/O can differ from VS to accommodate the desired interface voltage, as long as VS is greater than or equal to VDD I/O. When power cycling is required, VS and VDD I/O must be completely discharged (to GND) before powering the device back on.\n",

G | 22 of 36The ADXL345 incorporates a self-test feature that effectively tests its mechanical and electronic systems simultaneously. When the self-test function is enabled (via the SELF_TEST bit in the DA- TA_FORMAT register, Address 0x31), an electrostatic force is exert- ed on the mechanical sensor. This electrostatic force moves the mechanical sensing element in the same manner as acceleration, and it is additive to the acceleration experienced by the device.\n",
      "Tap sensing detects single and double taps in any direction. Free-fall sensing detects if the device is falling. These functions can be mapped individually to either of two interrupt output pins. An integrated memory management system with a 32-level first in, first out (FIFO) buffer can be used to store data to minimize host processor activity and lower overall system power consumption. Low power modes enable intelligent motion-based power manage- ment with threshold sensing and active acceleration measurement at extremely low power dissipation.\n",

      "The ADXL345 has two power modes: normal operation and reduced power operation. The device automatically modulates its power consumption in proportion to its output data rate. If additional power savings is desired, a lower power mode is available. The device is in standby mode at power-up, awaiting a command to enter measurement mode, and all sensor functions are off. After the device is instructed to enter measurement mode, all sensor functions are available.
